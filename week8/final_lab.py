#Prompt: Write a program that can be used by a small theater to sell tickets for performances. The theaterâ€™s auditorium has 15 rows of seats with 30 seats in each row. The program should display a screen that shows which seats are available and which are taken. Seats thar are available are represented by # and seats that are taken are represent by a *. There are aisles after seats H and V.

#variable dictionary:
#columns - a string of the alphabet and numbers
#rows - a list of lists that contains the rows and columns of the theater
#cart - a list that contains the seats that have been taken
#calculate_price - a function that calculates the price of the seat based on the row
#display_seats - a function that displays the seats in the theater
#prompt_menu - a function that prompts the user to select an option from the menu
#get_column_index - a function that returns the index of the column
#get_column_name - a function that returns the column name
#is_seat_available - a function that returns the row and column index of the seat
#add_to_cart - a function that adds the seat to the cart
#view_total_seat_sales - a function that displays the total seat sales
#view_seat_information - a function that displays the seat information
#checkout - a function that checks out the user
#handle_answer - a function that handles the answer from the user
